# odin-signup-form
Repo for the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course on forms and forms validation 

Initial goal is to match the following image in terms of format:

![image](goal\sign-up-form.png)

The only 'dynamics' so to speak is the border colors of the fields, which should be 
<li> Blue if focused on
<li> Red if failed password match

My browser already did the blue focus part - and im using chromium - and I know what I would do if I were designing 
for multiple browsers is to use the meyer reset first then apply style, but would rather learn more things
